Money has been the most disputable matter throughout the human history. What is money for? And when did it appear? Money is a universal means of payment and a means of exchange. It appeared thousands of years ago. First people used things like animal skin and precious metals as money. But it wasn't easy to carry and store them. The money we use nowadays is made of paper and cheap metals. They are banknotes and coins of different value. Everybody uses money in our modern world. We all need money, we think about it and work for it. It is difficult to imagine today's life without banknotes and coins, credit cards and cash. Modern technologies have influenced the way of payment: and plastic cards are becoming more and more popular today and they can be accepted even abroad. It's really convenient and safe for travelers because you don't have to carry the money in your wallet or exchange the currency in order to make purchases in foreign countries. We need money to live and buy desired things and services. We can't travel around the world, buy a car, rent an office, use the Internet or just buy food and clothes without money. People who earn much money can afford luxury goods: expensive cars and fantastic mansions, precious stones and unique works of art. The more money you earn, the more products you can buy. We must admit that being a millionaire is always dangerous. Rich people spend a lot on security because they are often robbed, kidnapped and even killed. To my mind, money and happiness are not synonyms. Money doesn't always mean well-being and prosperity. Sometimes money ruins people's lives and destroys families. People who value material things only, who care too much about money cannot be happy. Happiness depends both on material and spiritual things. And you can't buy health, love or true friends with money.
